This is a small wrapper around the c library [[https://github.com/json-c/json-c][json-c]], to use it from
[[https://github.com/shirok/Gauche][Gauche Scheme]]. The problem with the provided module ~rfc.json~ is,
that it is extremely slow for larger files.

This modules provides three functions ~parse-json~, ~parse-json*~ and
~parse-json-string~, so replacing the integrated ~rfc.json~ module
should be straight forward.

* Limitations
- ~parse-json*~ assumes one valid JSON entry per line.
- As json-c uses 64 bit (u)int internally the max/min values for integers are
  18446744073709551615/-9223372036854775808 respectively.

* Todo
- [X] map ~null~ to 'null, currently it's mapped to ~()~
- [ ] max nesting depth of json objects/arrays is currently 128, make
  this dynamic
- [ ] add other json utility functions
- [X] import stuff from ~rfc.json~ and reexport for convenience
