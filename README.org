This is a small wrapper around the c library [[https://github.com/json-c/json-c][json-c]], to use it from
[[https://github.com/shirok/Gauche][Gauche Scheme]]. The problem with the provided module ~rfc.json~ is,
that it is extremely slow for larger files.

This modules provides three functions ~parse-json~, ~parse-json*~ and
~parse-json-string~, so replacing the integrated ~rfc.json~ module
should be straight forward.

One Limitation is, that ~parse-json*~ assumes one valid JSON
entry per line.
